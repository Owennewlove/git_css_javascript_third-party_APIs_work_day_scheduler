# git_css_javascript_third-party_APIs_work_day_scheduler


## Description

The goal was to make a schedule planner that displayed a normal 9 to 5 work day. The planner needed to be able to allow the user to input events that would take place during the day and to save these events so they would show when reloading the website. Jquery within javascript was utilized to make this possible. Vairables, moment, Set Local storage, get local storage, .on click events, etc. were all used in the creation of this website. Also, the CSS provided needed to be modified to better the UI design of the website.
